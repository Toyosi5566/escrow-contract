    // ── dispute_arbitration_split: storage-optimised key design ────────────
    //
    // Design rationale
    // ─────────────────
    // A naïve split-state layout would persist a full `RefundAllocation`
    // (2×i128 + 2×u32) under Address-bearing keys such as
    // `(arbiter: Address, milestone_index: u32)`.  On Soroban each Address
    // contributes ~32 bytes to the ledger key footprint.
    //
    // This implementation uses three optimisations to minimise bytes stored:
    //
    // 1. **Key is only `u32`** (`ArbitrationSplitBps(milestone_index)`) —
    //    no Address payload in the key.
    //
    // 2. **Value is a single `u32` BPS** — freelancer BPS is derived as
    //    `BPS_SCALE - client_refund_bps`, so the second BPS field and both
    //    i128 payout amounts are never written to storage (amounts live in
    //    the persistent `Milestone` entry already required for settlement).
    //
    // 3. **Temporary storage tier** — the compact BPS signal is auto-evicted
    //    after the dispute workflow ends rather than accruing persistent rent.
    //
    // Deterministic access: the same milestone index always maps to the same
    // key; reads never require scanning Address-keyed maps.

    /// Allocate a disputed amount into client refund vs freelancer payout by BPS.

    // ── multisig approval: storage-optimised key design ────────────────────
    //
    // Design rationale
    // ─────────────────
    // Traditional multisig implementations store approval state as individual
    // `(Address, ProposalId) → bool` entries, which is expensive on Soroban
    // because each Address contributes ~32 bytes to the ledger key footprint.
    //
    // This implementation uses three optimisations to minimise bytes stored:
    //
    // 1. **Signer list is stored once** (instance storage) under a single
    //    `MultiSigSigners` key rather than storing individual key-value pairs
    //    per signer.
    //
    // 2. **Approval tracking uses a compact u32 bitmap** in temporary storage
    //    under `MultiSigApproval(proposal_id)`.  Each bit represents one signer
    //    by its index in the signers vec, eliminating the Address overhead from
    //    every approval entry.  Up to 32 signers are supported per proposal.
    //
    // 3. **Temporary storage tier** is used for the bitmap so that the ledger
    //    footprint is automatically evicted once the proposal lifecycle ends,
    //    rather than persisting indefinitely.

// ── escrow_interest_yield: admin emergency override endpoints ─────────────────
//
// Design rationale
// ─────────────────
// In rare operational conditions (e.g. a client or freelancer becoming
// unresponsive, a key being compromised, or yield accounting needing manual
// correction) the platform admin must be able to resolve a locked escrow
// without depending on the normal multi-party workflow.  These endpoints are
// intentionally narrow in scope:
//
//   • Every function requires a fresh `admin.require_auth()` and then verifies
//     the supplied address against the persisted `DataKey::Admin` value, so no
//     other address — including the client, freelancer, or arbiter — can ever
//     invoke them.
//
//   • Overrides are not gated on milestone status; the admin can act on a
//     milestone in ANY state (Pending, Delivered, PartiallyReleased, Disputed,
//     etc.) so that genuinely stuck escrows can always be resolved.
//
//   • Every action emits a structured on-chain event so that off-chain
//     indexers, auditors, and the parties involved receive an immutable record
//     of what happened and who authorised it.

// ── multisig_approval: admin emergency override & split-refund endpoints ────
//
// Design rationale
// ─────────────────
// In multi-signature escrow workflows, deadlocks can arise when one or more
// signers become unresponsive or keys are compromised.  These endpoints give
// the platform admin the ability to resolve locked multisig conditions
// unilaterally while emitting immutable on-chain events for auditability.
//
//   • Every admin function requires a fresh `admin.require_auth()` and then
//     verifies the supplied address against `DataKey::Admin`, so no other
//     address can invoke them.
//
//   • The `multisig_split_refund` helper implements refund distribution
//     pathways for split-refund claims, returning a `RefundAllocation`
//     struct that downstream code can use to execute proportional transfers
//     between client and freelancer.
//
//   • Every action emits a structured on-chain event so that off-chain
//     indexers, auditors, and the parties involved receive an immutable record.
